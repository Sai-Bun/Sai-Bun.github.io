<p class="Bio2">Heyo !! The name's Katie, but I also go by K. I'm an artist that does both digital and traditional art.
As well a little bit of basic coding and website building.
Though I mostly speciallize in art since I've been drawing most of my life.
To the side is a picture of my fursona. I love animals and I'm very good at drawing them too since I draw them frequently.</p>
